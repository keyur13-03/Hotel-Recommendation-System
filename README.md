# Hotel-Recommendation-System
The recommendation system is one of the most significant technology in the internet and electronic commercial market, with raising number of users and merchandises. They are basically built to develop recommendations or suggestions such as restaurants, places, movies, hotels and so on. Content based filtering only does recommendation relying on existing interest of users, which means model has restricted capacity to expand on the usersâ€™ interest. In this project, we present a collaborative recommender system that predict and recommend five hotels using K nearest neighbour algorithm. In the proposed framework, after implementation of collaborative filtering using K nearest neighbour algorithm, when similarity of user crosses some threshold value, user is recommended with similar items.
